# traffic_data_evaluation
This repo is about the traffic data evalaution. We already have the GA to identify IDM model from NGSIM I80 data, now what we wanna do is
to simulate the IDM model on the similar road topology and validate the model by using the macro-parameters

This project is super easy, you can use it by modifying the *.sumocfg file for more complex setting and *..add.xml for 
the measurement setting. 
Then download sumo and open a terminal: sumo-gui hello.sumocfg.

Enjoy!
